# GenAI-FHIR-Test-Data-Generation

Automated FHIR Test Data creation by developing a solution using Python, Azure Functions, and Prompt Engineering to generate FHIR bundles using key healthcare resources. The generation API allows test data creation with dynamic customisation by providing the ability to override any desired parameter with user-provided values. The validation API helps to validate the generated FHIR bundles.
